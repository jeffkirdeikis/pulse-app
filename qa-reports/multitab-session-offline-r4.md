| SESS-004 | Loading URL with hash opens correct tab | PASS | All hash URLs load correct tab: #classes=>classes, #events=>events, #deals=>deals, #services=>services, #wellness=>wellness |

## Offline Handling Tests

| Test ID | Title | Status | Details |
|---------|-------|--------|--------|

| OFF-004 | App shows error/offline message when offline | WARN | No offline message shown - app continues displaying cached content silently. Body length: 373 chars. This is acceptable if data was already loaded, but no explicit offline indicator exists. |
| OFF-005 | Loading app from scratch while offline | PASS | Result: browser shows connection error page (expected). Without a service worker, the app cannot load from scratch while offline - this is expected behavior. |

## Issues Found

**Status**: WARN

**Details**: No offline message shown - app continues displaying cached content silently. Body length: 373 chars. This is acceptable if data was already loaded, but no explicit offline indicator exists.
